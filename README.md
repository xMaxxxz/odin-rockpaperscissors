At the moment this project can solely be played in the console. It exists as a JavaScript skeleton that hopefully will get a nicer appearance sometime soon. Additional features or changes are listed below.

UPDATE: I will now attempt to make this simple project a more user-friendly game, using my newly acquired knowledge of DOM manipulation. The goal is to provide the same game, but make the GUI a lot prettier.

I made an addition I don't think was implied in the task by TOP. The user is now able to view the selection of the computer itself, which makes the page a lot more dynamic.

I seem to be done with this little experiment for now. Maybe I'll come and make the interface prettier with some CSS, but the JavaScript seems to fit very neatly, if I may say so myself.
The other thing that might be worth my time is to take a look at the code after I've progressed a bit and try to tidy it up.

Responsive design. I forgot about this, but I should definitely figure that out too.
